Samples Guidelines
===

The following are guidelines for producing sample files to use and enjoy wirthe the vA3C Viewer

## Data formats

Generally, sample files should follow that latest Three.js JSON format as published on the [Three.js Wiki]( https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/wiki )

Samples files should be tested using the [Three.js Editor]( http://mrdoob.github.io/three.js/editor/ ).

If the sample loads and displays correctly in the Three.js Editor and the vA3C viewer then it's good to go.

## Model Parameters

Scale: at the scale they were produced  

* Note that the default box is 100 x 100 x 100
* If you model is to be embedded with other models then it should display well in that box
* Supply guidance on what scale - other than 1:1 you would like the viewer to use

Origin

* At the bottom lower left corner of the project is nice
	* Especially if the model is to be inserted into another model
* At the bottom center of the project is nice

Rotation

* Use the model's grid
* Supply guidance if not North/South


## Copyrights

## Description

A paragraph or two decsribing the special aspects or principles of the project in a text file would be nice

## BIM Considerations

* Link to ontology or categorization schema
* Links to spec
* Links to project management dates

## Other Nice things to Have

* Series of models that have a theme
	* Five is a nice number
